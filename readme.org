#+TITLE: Compile-time computation via C++ Template Metaprogramming
#+AUTHOR: Alexandre Perez
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

This repository contains compile-time implementations of common programming
exercises. Compile-time computation is achieved through C++ template
metaprogramming, mostly using template matching, type aliasing and subtyping as
basic building blocks.

* Contents
  - [[./common/][common/]]: libraries implementing shared functionality. Contains
    implementations of type lists, conditionals, lambdas, among others.
  - [[./turing-machine][turing-machine/]]: a Turing Machine simulator.
  - [[./brainfuck/][brainfuck/]]: an interpreter for the Brainfuck programming language.
